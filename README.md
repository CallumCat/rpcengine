# RPC | Engine
A simple application to set custom Discord Rich Presence statuses!



### __What is it?__
Discord Rich Presence, or RCP for short, is a way to show off what you're doing on your computer inside discord. It normally supports anything from playing games to developing applications, but it's biggest problem is **lack of customization**. 


**Rpcengine** fills the gap discord usual **rich preseence** leaves open, and provides an easy way to create **custom** and **fully editable** rich presence statuses. Just install the app, run it and start flexing on people too lazy to google.

## Getting Started

Rcpengine is made in a way that basically anyone can use it and have a good time. [TODO: Add the goddamn settings]
